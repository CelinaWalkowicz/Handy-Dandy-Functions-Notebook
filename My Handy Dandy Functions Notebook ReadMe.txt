Handy Dandy Functions Notebook
-------------------------------

This repository will consist of changes to My Handy Dandy Functions Notebook,
which was produced during my time of study at BloomTech (Formerly Lambda School).

My experience at BloomTech is my initial experience with coding, and I hope this
repository may serve an archive of developed skills.
